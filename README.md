# ReaPack Repository Template

reapack-index looks for package files in subfolders.
The folder tree represents the package categories shown in ReaPack.

Each package file is expected to begin with a metadata header.
See [Packaging Documentation](https://github.com/cfillion/reapack-index/wiki/Packaging-Documentation) on reapack-index's wiki.

The URL to import in ReaPack is [](https://github.com/frenchy64/frenchy64-reaper-scripts/raw/main/index.xml).
